description: Rules for optimizing performance in FastAPI applications, including asynchronous operations and caching.
globs: **/*.py
---
- Minimize blocking I/O operations; use asynchronous operations for all database calls and external API requests.
- Optimize data serialization and deserialization with Pydantic.
- Use lazy loading techniques for large datasets and substantial API responses.
- Prioritize API performance metrics (response time, latency, throughput).
- Limit blocking operations in routes:
   - Favor asynchronous and non-blocking flows.
   - Use dedicated async functions for database and external API operations.

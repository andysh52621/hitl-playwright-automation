  title: Bulk Edit & Take Action validation
  description: >
    As a QA engineer, I want to automate tests for Bulk Edit and Take Action
    to ensure these high-impact workflows remain stable across releases.

    This test validates:
      - Selecting multiple tasks from the grid.
      - Opening the Bulk Edit screen and validating editable fields.
      - Applying changes to selected tasks and verifying persistence.
      - Executing Take Action events on selected tasks.
      - Verifying backend updates reflect the intended actions (move, update, acknowledge).
      - Handling edge cases (no selection, incompatible schemas, failures mid-flow).
      - Logging results with CI output and pass/fail indicators.
      - Compatibility across supported environments and inclusion in regression suite.

  story: Navigate between task records
  title: Prev/Next navigation validation
  description: >
    As a Task Manager user, I want to use the Prev and Next buttons to navigate between task records
    so I can easily review multiple task entries without going back to the main list or refreshing the page.

    This test validates:
      - Visibility of Prev and Next buttons at the top right.
      - Correct behavior of Next and Prev navigation.
      - Proper enabling/disabling of Prev/Next at boundaries.
      - Product details update dynamically without a page refresh.
